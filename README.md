## Overview
### Description
Mango is a full stack manga reading app. It involved a web scraping from Mangasee123.com using a backend in Python, a middle-man service serving the front end iOS app for users. It will allow users to follow manga, read and download chapters.

The application will be made using Xcode and coded in Swift. This document will be used alongside a trello page to track the progress of the app. The wireframe of the app can be found here made using Figma.
